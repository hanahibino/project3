                        posting heavily filtered latte pictures, bonus points for catchphrases, succulents, and
                        otherwise millenial coffeeshop decor in the background. <br /><br />Order an iced coffee to go

                        Now that you're on Melrose, there's only one place to go, the Pink Wall. I heard that this was
                        the most photographed wall on Instagram. Formally known as the Paul Smith Pink Wall, the
                        infamous Instagram background stands as a historical landmark of the <q>Golden Age</q> of early
                        LA influencer culture. <br /><br />Although you may be backlit, this is the perfect opportunity
                        for another latte picture. And if you have a Instax or digital camera, you know what to do(flash
                        on!).

                        The obvious next move is to go take outfit pictures at the angel wing mural. Painted by Colette
                        Miller, the mural was unavoidable around 2015, with various renditions popping up all over the
                        world. <br /><br />This photo op lives near countless boutiques, consignment/secondhand stores,
                        and (on Sundays) the Melrose Trading Post.

                        Before Erewhon there was Urth. Make your way down Melrose to West Hollywood. Although originally
                        popularised for, you guessed it, Coffee, the <q>it-girls</q> lunched at Urth. Paninis, Salads,
                        Smoothies, paired with Matcha or Coffee so aethetically-pleasing, the food reminds you that
                        <q>phone eats first</q>. <br /><br />Bring a laptop and draft a
                        <q>Summer Morning Routine</q> video to film tomorrow or pull out your phone to take a flatlay
                        featuring the polaroid pictures from the pink wall this morning for the full experience!

                        <br /><br />Spend the rest of the afternoon on the pier, and come down to the beach during
